# PlaceMark
PlaceMark is an api and web application designed to allow users to keep track of places of interest, and store them under categories.
For example, someone looking to buy a house could use this to keep track of the houses they wish to view, and use the categories
to keep track of which houses they have viewed, rejected, or wish to buy.

In short, PlaceMark allows **users** to create **categories** in which they can store **places** of interest.
